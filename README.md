- Note: Windows builds have undergone very limited testing.

### Linux

- Download the `.flatpak` release package.
- If flatpak is not enabled, initialize it for the distribution

  - Ubuntu/Debian/etc (APT based systems):

    ```shell
    sudo apt update # update packages
    sudo apt install -y flatpak # install flatpak
    sudo apt install -y gnome-software-plugin-flatpak # optional, enables flathub packages in gnome sofware center
    flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
    ```

- Install the package

  - `flatpak install --user FlexiGPT-xyz.flatpak`
  - `flatpak info io.github.flexigpt.client`

- Running the app
  - Via launcher GUI: You can launch the app from the distributions's launcher. E.g: In Ubuntu: Press the window key, type flexigpt and click on icon.
  - Via terminal: `flatpak run io.github.flexigpt.client`
  - IF you use Nvidia propriety drivers, you will face a DMA buf issue. Below are the issue links and workaround for it:
    - If you have nvidia propriety drivers installed, it has upstream bugs open for webkit-gtk:
      - [Webkit issue 180739](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=180739)
      - [Webkit issue 262607](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=262607)
      - [Debian issue 1082139](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1082139)
      - [Wails issue 2977](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/2977)
    - You can workaround this by running the app as:
      - `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 flatpak run io.github.flexigpt.client`.
      - OR use `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` instead in above run command.
      - OR if you are ok with making system chnages:
        - `cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset`
        - If you see printed N then you need to enable it with: `echo options nvidia_drm modeset=1 | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia_drm.conf`
        - Restart machine
  - IF you use `Mate` or other `gnome 2` based systems, you may get lib-appmenu and lib-canberra issues. Workaround:
    - `sudo apt install appmenu-gtk2-module appmenu-gtk3-module libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module -y`
    - Then run app: `flatpak run io.github.flexigpt.client`
- Your local data (settings, conversations, logs) will be at:
  - `~/.var/app/io.github.flexigpt.client/`
